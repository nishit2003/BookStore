# Book Store - MERN Stack Project




## Introduction

Welcome to my comprehensive Full Stack Application project! This repository is the culmination of my efforts to build a complete application from scratch using Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB, and React. Through this project, I aim to guide you through the entire process of developing a robust backend with Node.js and Express.js, integrating a MongoDB database with Mongoose, and creating a dynamic frontend using React, Vite, and Tailwind CSS.

## Project Overview

This project is organized into several key stages, each designed to focus on different aspects of full stack development:

1. **Create Node.js project from scratch**: I started by setting up the foundational structure for the Node.js application.
2. **Create our first HTTP Route**: Developed a basic HTTP route to handle client requests.
3. **Add MongoDB and Mongoose to Node.js**: Integrated MongoDB as the database and used Mongoose for data modeling.
4. **Create Book model with Mongoose**: Defined a schema and model for managing book records in MongoDB.
5. **Save a new Book with Mongoose**: Implemented functionality to add new books to the database.
6. **Get All Books with Mongoose**: Built functionality to retrieve and display all books stored in the database.
7. **Get One Book by ID with Mongoose**: Added the ability to fetch details of a specific book using its unique identifier.
8. **Update a Book with Mongoose**: Enabled updating of existing book records.
9. **Delete a Book with Mongoose**: Added functionality to remove books from the database.
10. **Refactor Node.js with Express Router**: Organized the codebase by using Express Router for better route management.
11. **CORS policy in Node.js and Express.js**: Implemented Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) to handle requests from different origins.
12. **Create React project, Vite, Tailwind CSS**: Set up the frontend using React, Vite for fast builds, and Tailwind CSS for styling.
13. **SPA and Add React Router DOM**: Developed a Single Page Application (SPA) and used React Router DOM for client-side routing.
14. **Show Books List in React**: Displayed the list of books on the frontend.
15. **Show Book Details in React**: Created a detailed view for individual books.
16. **Create Book in React**: Implemented a form to add new books from the frontend.
17. **Edit Book in React**: Enabled editing of existing books through the frontend.
18. **Delete Book in React**: Provided an option to delete books from the frontend.
19. **Show Books List as Card**: Presented books in a card-based layout for a better visual experience.
20. **Make Book Card a single component**: Refactored the book card into a reusable component.
21. **Add Book Modal**: Introduced modals for enhanced interactivity, such as adding or editing books.
22. **Improve User Experience (UX) with beautiful alert**: Enhanced the user experience with visually appealing alerts and notifications.
